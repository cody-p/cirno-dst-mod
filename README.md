# cirno-dst-mod

A mod I'm making for Don't Starve Together. It is currently not 
released, but it's very close.

The "Cirno" mod is the one that needs to actually be in the don't starve 
together mods folder.

This upload is primarily for portfolio showcasing, and developer convenience.
Prospective users are requested to wait until the mod is uploaded
to the Steam Workshop to use it; There's a reason it's not already on there
after all. Of course, if you want to use it before it's ready, I won't
stop you.
